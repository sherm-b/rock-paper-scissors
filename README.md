Reflections - 

Man this was so much fun to build! I had some issues with overcomplication
at first, but once I got my foundation down and started tackling problems
one at a time, it slowly but surely started to click into place. My biggest
issue was a misunderstanding of the return statement, and how it will stop
a loop when it's called. When I realized what I was actually trying to do
with it, it was an easy fix. Also, taking more than one variable out of a
function was a bit tricky, but I'm glad I have a trick up my sleeve for it
 now.

Overall, I can't believe I went from my first line of code to a program I
wouldn't have even known where to start with in such a short time.
Thank you to The Odin Project for helping me attain the skills to do this.
