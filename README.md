pre-ui:
Man this was so much fun to build! I had some issues with overcomplication
at first, but once I got my foundation down and started tackling problems
one at a time, it slowly but surely started to click into place. My biggest
issue was a misunderstanding of the return statement, and how it will stop
a loop when it's called. When I realized what I was actually trying to do
with it, it was an easy fix. Also, taking more than one variable out of a
function was a bit tricky, but I'm glad I have a trick up my sleeve for it
 now.

Overall, I can't believe I went from my first line of code to a program I
wouldn't have even known where to start with in such a short time.
Thank you to The Odin Project for helping me attain the skills to do this.

While I doubt my code is the most efficient it could be, I'm pretty proud of
this. The added complication of using eventListeners for the buttons was a 
bit stressful to figure out, and I'm positive I can do it better. I'm going 
to revisit this when I have a better understanding of nodelists and 
try to consolidate all of the functionality of the player input buttons into
something more compact. As for now, it works, and it looks decent in my opinion.
